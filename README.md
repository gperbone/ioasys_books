# ioasys books

### This is the first app I made from scratch. ðŸŽ‰
It was built as the conclusion challenge for a bootcamp offered by the company Ioasys.

During the bootcamp, we were exposed to various themes on the iOS development universe, and were instigated to pursue deeper information. At the end, we were given the link to the [app design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/GUAXs1D2D6bv0yvSMwYb7R/Books-%5BiOS%5D?node-id=0%3A1).

**This has been my first experience builing an app with UIKit, constraints, ViewCode and Networking (GET and POST).**
